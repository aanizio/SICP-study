Our programs
would be able to compute cubes, but our language would lack the ability
to express the concept of cubing.

One of the things we should demand
from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstrac-
tions by assigning names to common paerns and then to work in terms
of the abstractions directly. Procedures provide this ability.

- parameters vs arguments. Not treated by the book, but there's the distinction
- Differences building iterative and recursive processes on building it
    - recursive need a final that results in a default value, like 0
    - iterative processes need a final condition that results in the final result
- Applicative order vs normal order
- Average damping: sucessive averages
- Data abstraction:
	- "The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that are to use compound data objects so that they operate on “abstract data.” That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make no assumptions about the data that are not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand."
